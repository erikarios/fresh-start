# Everyday is a Fresh Start

## Description
**Everyday is a Fresh Start** aims to help users who are in active recovery and those who want to start the journey of sobriety in the LA area. The goal of this app is to help users track the number of days that they have been sober and give them resources for extra support along the way.

### Check In
On the homepage, a counter displays the number of continuous days the user has been sober. The user is to log in daily and incremnet each day by pressing the button labeled New Day. The counter is to serve as a visual representation of the user's journey and acknowledge and celebrate another day of sobriety. Understandably sobriety is a difficult journey and not always a straightforward path. The other button labeled Reset would be used to reset the counter and tackle the next day as a fresh start.

### Resources
The resource page will include four major specific local resources: two resources geared towards recovery and two resources geared towards harm reduction. Users can find a clear summary of what each resource is and can click on the resource for more information. It was important to me to include resources geared toward harm reduction because even though the goal is sobriety, recovery is not always linear.I want the users to be able to have the knowledge of resources that can help potentially save their lives. The specific links I have chosen are with the users in mind. They are easy to navigate and easy to use. 

### Optimizations
A notes/journal section will be added so users can write down their wins, thoughts, or feelings. The user would also be able to reflect back on those journal entries.
